# Notification

## Introduction

ROQ's notification system allows you to reach your users or user groups through various channels:

- In-app notifications: These are loaded in real time, using a socket connection directly from your web app.
- SMS or push messages: Send notifications directly to your users' mobile phones.
- Traditional e-mails: Deliver messages straight to the users' inbox.

Users have the ability to customize their preferences for each type of notification. For example, they can choose to receive alerts through push messages while getting product updates via e-mail.

## How to add a new notification
